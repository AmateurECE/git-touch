# git-touch, A Convenient Git Extension

This application is almost too stupidly simple to exist, but it's a small
quality-of-life improvement for my development workflow (and hopefully others,
as well).

I write the following two commands a lot:

```
$ touch source/myfile.c
$ git add source/myfile.c
```

With this application installed, I can just run:

```
$ git touch source/myfile.c
```

Yep, that's all it does. Enjoy!
